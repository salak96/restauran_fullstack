# Express.js Project with Sequelize and dotenv

This is a simple Express.js application that uses Sequelize for database management and dotenv for handling environment variables. It serves as a basic setup for a Node.js API with SQL database integration.

## Features

- **Express.js** for building the web server and handling routes.
``bash
npm install -g express-generator
``

- **Sequelize** as NO view
``bash
  express --no-view
``

- **dotenv** for managing environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
``bash
  npm install -g dotenv
``

## Dependencies
- **Sequelize** as an ORM for interacting with SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
- **dotenv** for managing environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
